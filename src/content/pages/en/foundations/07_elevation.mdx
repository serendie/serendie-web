    Drop shadows cast a shadow behind objects, and their strength expresses depth. We define five elevation levels from Level1 to Level5.

    Level0 is the body (surface), and most UI components sit at Level0. Align levels with common UI behavior—for example, the open menu of a <PageA href="/components/dropdown-menu">DropdownMenu</PageA> is Level1, <PageA href="/components/toast">Toast</PageA> is Level3, and <PageA href="/components/modal-dialog">Modal Dialog</PageA> and <PageA href="/components/drawer">Drawer</PageA> are Level5.

    ## Notes for use in Figma

    Drop shadows are composed of several values, such as shadow color, position, and blur. Figma Variables do not yet support grouped tokens (called <PageA href="https://tr.designtokens.org/format/#composite-design-token">Composite Tokens</PageA>). Therefore, shadows are defined as **Effect Styles rather than Variables**, so the application method differs from other tokens.

  <PageSection>
    <PageHeadLine number={2}>z-index</PageHeadLine>

      z-index is the CSS property that controls stacking order; higher values mean higher layers. We define z-index values as system tokens, but because they are implementation tokens, you do not need to consider them in Figma.

      **Shadows represent visual elevation, while z-index represents implementation elevation.** Carefully controlling z-index values is important for robust UI, so token names carry strong semantic meaning. See the <PageA href="/en/foundations/design-tokens/system-tokens">System Token</PageA> list for details.
