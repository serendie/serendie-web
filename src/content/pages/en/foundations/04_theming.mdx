    To match tones and manners across business domains, we currently provide five color themes. Each theme is designed based on the traditional Japanese colors used by the [Serendie brand](https://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/serendie/). We plan to add and update themes according to future needs.

    ## KONJO

    A theme based on indigo blue. Indigo is also the base color of [Mitsubishi Electric Serendie St. Yokohama](https://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/serendie/), so this is the default theme.

    ## ASAGI

    A theme based on pale blue-green.

    ## SUMIRE

    A theme based on violet.

    ## KURIKAWA

    A theme based on chestnut brown.

    ## TSUTSUJI

    <PageHeadLine number={3}>Switching themes in Figma</PageHeadLine>

    Each theme is treated as a [Variable mode](https://help.figma.com/hc/ja/articles/15343816063383-%E3%83%90%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89) in Figma. Variable modes let you assign modes (themes) defined in Figma Variables to pages, sections, frames, and more.

    For example, assigning “ASAGI” to a page switches all Serendie UI within that page to the ASAGI theme.
